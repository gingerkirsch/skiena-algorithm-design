2-1. What value is returned by the following function? Express your answer as a function of n.
Give the worst-case running time using the Big Oh notation.
function mystery(n)
  r := 0
  for i := 1 to n − 1 do
    for j := i + 1 to n do
      for k := 1 to j do
        r := r + 1
  return(r)

O(n^3) as we will be walking through the array 3 times.  (n^3 + n)/n


2-2. What value is returned by the following function? Express your answer as a function of n.
Give the worst-case running time using Big Oh notation.
function pesky(n) r := 0
  for i := 1 to n do
    for j := 1 to i do
      for k := j to i + j do
         r := r + 1
  return(r)

O(n^3) - walking through the array 3 times

2-3. What value is returned by the following function? Express your answer as a function of n.
Give the worst-case running time using Big Oh notation.
function prestiferous(n) r := 0
  for i := 1 to n do
    for j := 1 to i do
      for k := j to i + j do
        for l := 1 to i + j − k do
          r := r + 1
  return(r)
O(n^4) - walking through the array 4 times

2-4. What value is returned by the following function? Express your answer as a function of n.
Give the worst-case running time using Big Oh notation.
function conundrum(n) r := 0
  for i := 1 to n do
    for j := i + 1 to n do
      for k := i + j − 1 to n do
        r := r + 1
  return(r)
O(n^3)

2-5. Suppose the following algorithm is used to evaluate the polynomial p(x)=anxn+an−1xn−1+…+a1x+a0
   p:=a0;
   xpower:=1;
   for i:=1 to n do
   xpower:=x∗xpower;
   p:=p+ai∗xpower
   end

How many multiplications are done in the worst-case? n How many additions? n
How many multiplications are done on the average? n
Can you improve this algorithm? https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horner's_method

2-6. Prove that the following algorithm for computing the maximum value in an
array A[1..n] is correct.
function max(A)
     m:=A[1]
     for i:=2 to n do
           if A[i]>m then m:=A[i]
     return (m)
Induction - for 1, 2.. n

2-7. True or False?

Is 2n+1=O(2n)?  true
Is 22n=O(2n)?   false : lim n-> inf (2^2n / 2^n)

2-8. For each of the following pairs of functions, either f(n) is in O(g(n)), f(n) is in Ω(g(n)), or f(n)=Θ(g(n)). Determine which relationship is correct and briefly explain why.

f(n)=logn2; g(n)=logn + 5
f(n)=n√; g(n)=logn2
f(n)=log2n; g(n)=logn
f(n)=n; g(n)=log2n
f(n)=nlogn+n; g(n)=logn
f(n)=10; g(n)=log10
f(n)=2n; g(n)=10n2
f(n)=2n; g(n)=3n
